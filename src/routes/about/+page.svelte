                    Mastery: The Student Research Journal (MSRJ) is a student-led, multidisciplinary high school research 
                    journal based at the Mastery School of Hawken in Cleveland, Ohio. Founded in 2024 by student Imre Huss 
                    ’26 and faculty member Ms. Ailey Picasso, the journal was established to create a lasting space for 
                    rigorous academic inquiry, meaningful student scholarship, and public showcasing of the intellectual 
                    work produced across its core disciplines: Social Sciences, Policy, and Law; Natural and Physical 
                    Sciences; and Humanities and Culture.

                <p class="mt-2 indent-8">
                    The journal uses a blended faculty and student review model. Every submission goes through a 
                    single-blind review process involving both subject-area faculty and trained student reviewers, ensuring 
                    that each published piece is evaluated for clarity, accuracy, and depth.

                <p class="mt-2 indent-8">
                    The journal is published biannually in digital form at <a href="/issues" class="underline text-blue-500 hover:text-blue-300">https://masteryjournal.org/issues</a>, 
                    with a curated print edition 
                    released annually. It disseminates student research within the Mastery School of Hawken community while 
                    also placing student scholarship into broader academic conversations, with articles indexed on platforms 
                    such as ResearchGate and Google Scholar.
